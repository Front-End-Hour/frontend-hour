// A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

// A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself, otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely. So a recursive function typically looks like the following:

function recurse() {
    if (condition) {
        // stop calling itself
        //...
    } else {
        recurse();
    }
}

// Generally, recursive functions are used to break down a big problem into smaller ones. You can find that they are heavily used in the data structures like binary trees and graphs and algorithms such as binary search and quicksort.
