- Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

Example 1:
```js
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```
Example 2:
```js 
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```
Example 3:
```js
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

- Follow up: Could you solve it without using any built-in BigInteger library or converting the inputs to integer directly?
