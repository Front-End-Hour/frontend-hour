#### Portals 

- *Protals* provides a first class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM heirarchy of the parent component. 
- A typical *usecase* of portals is when a parent component has an *overflow: hidden* or *z-index* style, but you need the child to *visually breakout* of its comtainer. 
- For example: Dialogs, Hovercards & Tooltips.
