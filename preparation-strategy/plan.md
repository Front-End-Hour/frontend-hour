## Prepration Strategy

1. Doing LC regularly for ~1.8 years.
2. Solved 1400 questions. Some would say, quality over quantity, but I didn't wanted to leave anything on luck.
3. For Google coding rounds, speed, accuracy, able to solve 2 questions in 40 minutes, thought process and speaking loud is important.
4. For Design, I mostly relied on youtube videos on various topics. Google gives lot of emphasis on leading the discussions, multiple approaches, pros & cons, bottlenecks and tradeoffs.
5. Youtube channels - Usenix, DevOxx, Hasgeek tv, etc. I used to watch company tech talks on how they solved a specific problem and what tech stack they used. For a year, built a habit of reading 10 medium articles daily to improve my knowledge in general not to crack interviews.
